### Most Probable Choice
We are currently leaning towards using the **Agriculture Crop Yield** dataset for our analysis, as it offers rich data and aligns well with our project goals.

## Team Roles

Each member of the group has specific responsibilities:

| Member                        | Role                                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Felisa Melanie Fay Bascug**  | Data Scientist (Basic Descriptive Statistics) |
| **Adrian Sajulga**             | Project Manager                        |
| **Stephen Clint Sales**        | Data Scientist (Visual Representation) |
| **Basil Xavier Mendoza**       | Data Engineer (Data Management, Report Findings) |

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Perform an initial exploration of the dataset, focusing on cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize key metrics and patterns found in the dataset (mean, median, distribution, etc.).
